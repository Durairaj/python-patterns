The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model that is used to value European call and put options on non-dividend-paying stocks. It was developed in the 1970s by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, and it has become a widely used tool in finance for valuing financial options and assessing the risks and potential returns of option trading strategies.

The Black-Scholes model is based on a number of assumptions, including:

The underlying asset follows a lognormal distribution, which means that the logarithm of the asset's price follows a normal distribution.
The risk-free interest rate is constant.
There are no transaction costs or taxes.
The option can be exercised only at expiration.
The Black-Scholes model uses these assumptions to derive a partial differential equation that can be used to value call and put options. The model provides closed-form solutions for the fair price of the options, as well as the fair value of the "Greeks," which are the sensitivities of the option price to various factors, such as the underlying asset price, the strike price, the time to expiration, and the implied volatility of the option.

While the Black-Scholes model has become a widely used tool in finance, it has a number of limitations and assumptions that may not always be accurate. For example, it assumes that the underlying asset follows a lognormal distribution, which may not always be the case. It also assumes that the risk-free interest rate is constant, which may not be realistic in practice. As a result, it is important to carefully consider the limitations and uncertainties of the Black-Scholes model and to use it in conjunction with other tools and techniques to value financial options.
