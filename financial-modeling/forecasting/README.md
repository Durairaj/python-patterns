inancial forecasting involves creating projections of a company's future financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Financial forecasting is an important tool for assessing the financial health of a company and making strategic decisions about financing, investments, and other matters.

There are many different methods and techniques that can be used for financial forecasting, including top-down approaches that rely on macroeconomic data and industry trends, and bottom-up approaches that use more detailed company-specific information. The specific method used will depend on the nature of the company and the level of detail and accuracy required.

This example defines a function forecast_financial_statements that takes as input the historical financial data of a company and a set of future assumptions, and returns a DataFrame with the projections for the financial statements. The projections are based on applying the future assumptions to the historical data and calculating the values of the financial statements using standard accounting relationships. The assumptions used in the example include the revenue growth rate, expense growth rate, depreciation growth rate, and starting cash balance growth rate.

You can adjust the inputs to the `forecast_financial_statements

If you need to build a more complex financial forecasting model that incorporates multiple variables and time-varying relationships, you may want to consider using a dynamic model that is able to capture the interactions between the different variables over time.

Dynamic financial models are typically more complex and require more data and computational resources to build and run. They are often used in situations where a high level of accuracy and detail is required, such as in risk modeling or capital budgeting.

Here is an example of how a dynamic financial forecasting model could be implemented in Python using the statsmodels library:
